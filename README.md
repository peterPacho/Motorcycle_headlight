## Description
Riding at night is fun but I really didn't like the fact that I couldn't see where I'm going when turning.
This project aims to solve that issue by creating a headlight housing that can rotate, counteracting the motorcycle's lean during the turn, making the projected beam always parallel to the road surface.

Since I couldn't get a reliable reading of the lean angle during the turn using a standard gyro/accelerometer, I'm using two Lidar sensors at the rear of the bike that measure the distance to the road surface.
This distance can then be used to estimate bike lean.
Add some 3D printed parts, stepper motor, display and couple buttons, and hereâ€™s the completed headlight.
